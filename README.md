# Blackjack Probability Calculator (WIP)

This project calculates the probabilities and expected values for various scenarios in the game of blackjack. It assumes the dealer does not hit on a soft 17 and uses an infinite-sized deck.

## Features

- **Dealer Probability Distribution**: Calculates the end probability distribution for the dealerâ€™s hand.
- **Conditioned Dealer Results**: Computes probabilities for the dealer's results conditioned on the dealer's first card.
- **Expected Value Calculation**: Calculates the expected value (EV) of the player's hand if they stand or hit.
- **EV Table for Player Hitting**: Generates an EV table for scenarios where the player hits.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
